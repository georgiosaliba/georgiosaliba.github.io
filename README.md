## MongoDB <br>
<p>Let’s start with a few key points about MongoDB itself:
stores data in JSON-like documents that can have various structures
uses dynamic schemas, which means that we can create records without predefining anything
the structure of a record can be changed simply by adding new fields or deleting existing ones
The above-mentioned data model gives us the ability to represent hierarchical relationships, to store arrays and other more complex structures easily.

##Terminologies<br>
<p>Understanding concepts in MongoDB becomes easier if we can compare them to relational database structures.
Let’s see the analogies between Mongo and a traditional MySQL system:
*Table in MySQL becomes a Collection in Mongo
*Row becomes a Document
*Column becomes a Field
*Joins are defined as linking and embedded documents
This is a simplistic way to look at the MongoDB core concepts of course, but nevertheless useful.
Now, let’s dive into implementation to understand this powerful database.
