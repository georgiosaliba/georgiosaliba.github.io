## MongoDB <br>
<p>Letâ€™s start with a few key points about MongoDB itself:
stores data in JSON-like documents that can have various structures
uses dynamic schemas, which means that we can create records without predefining anything
the structure of a record can be changed simply by adding new fields or deleting existing ones
The above-mentioned data model gives us the ability to represent hierarchical relationships, to store arrays and other more complex structures easily.
